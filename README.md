# Disney_DataBase_Creation

This project aims to create a comprehensive Disney database by scraping data from Wikipedia using Beautiful Soup and supplementing it with additional data from APIs. The resulting data will be cleaned and converted from JSON to CSV for easy integration into other applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Pandas
- Requests
- OMDb API Key (required for API calls)

## Limitations
1. The script only scrapes data from the English Wikipedia page for Disney movies. It does not scrape data from other language versions of the page.
2. The script only scrapes data for movies that have a dedicated Wikipedia page. It does not scrape data for movies that are only mentioned in other pages (e.g. lists of Disney movies).
3. The script may not capture all of the data for a given movie. Some movies may have additional information (such as composer or cinematographer) that is not captured by the script.
